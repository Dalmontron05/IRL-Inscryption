**I DID NOT CREATE INSCRYPTION** [Check out the original here](https://www.inscryption.com/)    
****
This is just a program accompanying my IRL version of Inscryption. It's based on Kaycee's Mod / Act 1 from the game.

# Differences from Kaycees mod
Stoat went from 2 health to 3 health

# Tje plan
- create a class for both the total cards and cards in a players hand
- class for sigils names, icon (maybe ascii arts), and description
- fecundity can only create one copy of a card (even if you have unkillable, it won't come back every other card) (sorry leshy and kaycee, had to be done).
